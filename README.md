# procps

## About

procps is a package to manage processes. Currently in its early stages
of development, the purpose is to enable people to use like
[psutil](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest) in Python.

## API

Being currently in its early stages of development, the API is subject
to changes. It supports Linux only currently. I may add a support for
BSD OSes, but I will unlikely support Windows, unless someone want to
provide patches for it.
